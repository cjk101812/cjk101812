<b>Heyo! Thanks for dropping by!</b>
I'm a full stack dev who helps the government #getShitDone by day, and constantly hacks on side-projects by night.  My core stack is anything JavaScript 
and I'm super passionate about frontend frameworks and API development.  I love learning and helping other people learn, so I started live coding on Twitch in July 2020.  Have fun poking around in the repos and hit me up if you have any questions!
